              <p>Hey, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/heybereket" target="_blank"><b>Bereket</b></a>. I'm a developer based in Toronto, Canada who has a passion for AI and how it can change the future moving forward. <br><br> 
                  I've had several challenges that I've had to overcome in my life but what keeps me going is the end goal. I always know that if I keep trying, my goals will be reached no matter how big that goal is. <br><br>
                  I'm a huge fan of creating <a href="./projects"><b>several types of tools</b></a> that help others do their thing and get stuff done. I love creating products that help teams and individuals become productive and engaged. <br><br>
                  I dabble in design and drawing so you can sometimes see me doing some things over on Figma, Sketch, and Adobe' tools. <br><br>
                  Currently, I'm constantly developing my skills every day. I love solving challenging problems in humanity and giving a simple solution for others. <br><br>
                  In the future, my plan is to start a tech startup to bring my <b>love</b> of coding and entrepreneurship together.</p>
