                <p>
                    It's not as hard as it might sound but it's not as easy too. Ideas are gold for launching successful products but only the best catch people's attention. <br><br> 
                    Before I tell you how I do it, in case your not familiar, I typically launch 2-3 products every week, below are some that I've already launched on <a href="https://producthunt.com" target="_blank">ProductHunt</a>: <br><br>
                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/vzhDYKw/Capture.png" style="width: 450px; border-radius: 10px;"> <br><br>
                    As you can tell from the image, most of the products have a decent amount of upvotes. You can view my most proudest projects <a href="..../projects" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">here</a>. <br><br>

                    Now, the part you came here for. How did I do it? <br><br>
                    My thought process into <b>every</b> single product I consider making, have launched, or done as an experiment becomes an idea, then I would make a poll on Twitter and ask for feedback, if people love the idea, I would create a sample build then show them the creation. 
                    Then, if the love that, I would prepare for a launch and launch it. <br><br>

                    To give you a better understanding, I made this quick image using <a href="https://figma.com">Figma</a> on what I do to create a product.

                    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/3SFNRvh/Capture.png" style="width: 450px; border-radius: 10px;"> <br><br>

                    However, with this all being said, I understand that a majority of you might not have such a "huge" online presence to get a ton of feedback. A good alternative would be to ask around, friends, communities like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discord Servers, Slack Groups, Facebook Groups, ProductHunt Discussions</span>, etc. <br><br>
                    If you haven't launched products in the past, don't fret or rush, it took me 4 months before I could consider launching my very first product, after your first product is launched, it just gets easier from there. <br><br>
                    Don't worry too much about SEO, a recent project <a href="https://memedealer.app" target="_blank">Meme Dealer</a> had over 15k users and I didn't even worry about SEO or any of that. <br><br>
                    Try to build the <b>actual</b> product and then worry about stuff like SEO. And, it's okay to use nocode tools like <a href="https://webflow.com" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, and <a href="https://shopfiy.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a>. Not everything has to be written by pure code, take advantage with resources around you if you have the budget, otherwise you learn by coding it yourself - which I would recommend to do! <br><br>

                    On the other hand, when you first come up with an idea try to think really hard about it, do research on other products that are similar and how you can have something even better, research is really helpful and useful when it comes to products or any startup as a whole. <br><br>
