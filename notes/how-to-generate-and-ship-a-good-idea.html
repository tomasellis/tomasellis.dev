                <h3>How to generate and ship a good idea</h3>

                <p>
                   Generating ideas is not as simple as it might seem, in fact I've had hundreds of ideas but only have built maybe 5 or 6 of them, why? <br><br> 
                   Well, you only have such little time and knowledge. Some ideas that I've had and successfully launched were Colortopia, Hidden Tools, and many more. <br><br>
                   The process of having an idea is hard. Look at the image below, you should be having questions while you have the idea, <b>before</b> you start building it, marketing it, etc.<br>

                   <img src="https://i.ibb.co/XLkjS39/Capture.png" style="width: 450px; border-radius: 10px;"> <br><br>

                    "Okay, I get it. How can I build my idea though?" <br><br> 
                    Now that you have a solid idea, you can move on. Building it, you can simply do this by either coding the project or using a nocode tool such as <a href="https://webflow.com">Webflow</a>, to build it. <br><br> 
                    That part is pretty self-explanatory, you just make the project, do the UI, etc. <br><br>

                    "Done that part, I'm ready to market and ship this thing!" <br><br> 
                    Awesome, if your not familiar with Twitter or don't know about it, I suggest making an account, <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is really helpful for marketing a product to a specific audience or just any audience in general <br><br>
                    Look at the image below for some resources of places you can market and launch your product to the world.

                    That's pretty much all you need to know! Make sure to connect with others on Twitter, and engage. Also feel free to look at videos/articles on how to use ProductHunt, IndieHackers, etc. <br><br>
